          <h2>Team Founded</h2>
          <p>During the fall of 1999, five Virginia Tech students were brought together by their shared enthusiasm for FIRST and their desire to continue spreading the powerful FIRST message. The meeting led to the formation of FIRST Competition Team 401, then called Power Surge.</p>

          <h2>Club becomes a Class</h2>
          <p>Team 401 competes in its first ever FRC competition in the 2000 season, Co-Opertition FIRST. In the fall of 2000, robotics would go from club to class by being integrated into the Montgomery County Public Schools curriculum for high school students.</p>

          <h2>Power Surge to Hokie GUARD</h2>
          <p>Team name changes from “Power Surge” to Hokie GUARD (Gladiators of the Ultra Advanced Robotics Division) to reflect Virginia Tech’s sponsorship. During this year, the team would go on to be finalists at the NASA Langley Regional and also the Curie Division Finalists at the National Championships.</p>

          <h2>College Mentor Class Added</h2>
          <p>College students can earn elective credit for participating as mentors in Team 401. The course skills necessary for leading diverse teams of people through a technical design project. Students manage teams of local high school students through an authentic technical design experience associated with design competitions. The course addresses the practical applications of science, math and engineering, while building and managing teams of people to meet technical project goals.</p>

          <h2>Day Classes Added</h2>
          <p>Robotics I is added as a day class, so first-year robotics students learn skills during the day and meet after school with veteran students to work on projects. During build season, all students are required to clock in at least 80 hours during build season and meet together and collaborate with veteran students acting as mentors to the rookie students.</p>

          <h2>Governor's Academy And Team Growth</h2>
          <p>This year, we nearly tripled the size of our team's student body. This is partially due to the fact that the robotics program is the centerpiece for the Governor's STEM Academy. This co-curricular experience is required to recieve the STEM seal on students' diplomas. Another reason for the rise in participation is the increase in awarness of FIRST in our school systems.
